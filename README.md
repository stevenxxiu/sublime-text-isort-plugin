Using isort
===========

By default isort command is run on save. To change this behaviour set your user/project settings to include:

    {
        "isort.sort_on_save": false,
    }

You can also run the command manually by bringing up the command menu, and select "isort: sort imports" command.

Note that the command is only visible, and runs on autosave, when used on "python files".
